Description: An implementation of the Kinase Set Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) used to predict kinase activities in quantitative phosphoproteomic studies. By providing a list of known targets for a set of kinases and a quantitative phosphoproteomic profile, the algorithm is able to predict the kinase activities by looking at sets of substrates differentially regulated in the given condition.
